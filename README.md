###### Background

This is a little project I've always wanted to work on but finally got around to doing. Originally I wanted to create a 3D rendering from scratch and be able to animate the whole thing into a screensaver, but I just haven't had the time to build a good 3D rendering, so I worked with a vid-cap of a shot from the movie and photoshopped the hell out of it.


###### Limitations

Many... I've only tested in Chrome and Safari on the Mac.
